Over the past ten or so years, there has been a wholesale reorientation occurring for many organisations. Digital disruption and the accelerating need to innovate to stay relevant has caused the imperative to change, and digital has been the enabler for much of the response. But *the real driver has been a change in business practices that puts the customer at the center of the business relationship.* 

> In this new paradigm, being able to connect and engage with customers instantly becomes paramount, as does the need for fast feedback loops that allow product feature development and iteration.

IT systems have been going through a modernisation process to meet these requirements, resulting in new architectural design patterns and infrastructure models, including use of multi-cloud providers and more composable, component-driven software development. On an organizational front, enterprises have employed more developers and are now competing for top talent, while also needing to reach new productivity gains rather than get swamped in the complexity of too many autonomous teams.

This modernisation process has also allowed businesses to connect to different systems through APIs, giving rise to an API economy in which external capabilities can be plugged in to a companyâ€™s IT infrastructure. APIs also allow a business to create new mobile and digital products faster by reusing these components each time.

Customer expectations for product and feature development have also grown. Businesses need to have responsive websites that load fast and offer instant functionality in the browser. This has given rise to single page applications and edge networks that allow caching of content close to customers.

The **JAMstack** *(a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup)* leverages these modernised IT systems and increased developer workforces to create always-on, highly performant, web products.
